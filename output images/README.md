The output images I create from my grid procedures are organized by CO emission analysis. The folder named Fluxes contains CO Flux
lines measured from the continuum-normalized spectra. The folder named Luminosities has CO Luminosity measurements taken from the
CO flux + calibrated with W2 flux and converted to luminosity using the distance to the system.

### Naming convention

The following naming conventions were used for all output images.

- `by shapes`: scatter points are categorized by shape
- `-clean`: statistics like correlation coefficient and intrinsic scatter is removed to make clean view
- `+label`: added the names of the disks to their respective emission lines
- `-outlier`: removed general outliers including MWC 297 and TW Hya
- `-lowmass`: removed low mass outliers: AA Tau and Wa Oph6
