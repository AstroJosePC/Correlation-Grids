# Correlation Grids

This repository stores code for correlation studies of protoplantary disk CO emission for my master's thesis. My thesis focuses on
a statistical analysis of infrared CO emission lines from a diverse sample of protoplanetary disks with known star and disk
properties to study structure of inner disk molecular gas. The code is mainly used to generate a grid of scatter plots with linear
regression fits from a source dataset. In theory it can do much more, but its limitations are yet to be tested. The interface is
very customizable and can be as simple or as complex as desired.

Most of the code is written by me. The script /utils/linmix.py is from https://github.com/jmeyers314/linmix. Major components of
the code are subclasses of seaborn objects, and therefore uses similar structure and snippets from their original project.

# DEPENDENCIES

This code makes use of the following python libraries:

```
+ Numpy
+ seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
+ others [to be completed]
```

All of them are open source and can be easily installed in any machine.

**Anything below is a work in progress**

# Jupyter Notebooks

Here I will explain what the notebooks are for, and how the reader can find them useful.

# Output images

What each image is, and how they help in my thesis?

# Code Structure

Here I can lay out the code structure and usages.
